//* if we want to format output files, we can use INREC and OUTREC *//

SORT FIELDS=COPY
INREC FIELDS=(5:1,5,10:21,5)

SORT FIELDS=COPY
OUTREC FIELDS=(5:1,5,10:21,5)

//* both INREC and OUTREC are same. INREC doing all these formatting before sort and OUTREC is doing after sort. If we have many records, use INREC. It
performs better. *//
